            reason I wake up with a smile everyday. You've been such a fantastic girlfriend and given me nothing but
            love. Eres la mujer mas hermosa que a visto y la unica que quiero amar por el resto de mi vida. I'm so 
            happy that I get to call you mine and I want you to know that my heart belongs to you and only you.
            I'll always be yours princesa no matter what and i'll always be by your side. I'm lucky to have such an amazing girlfriend
            like you someone so caring, loving, beautiful, and capable of working so hard to achieve what they truly desire. I 
            promise to treat you with so much love all my life and to give you a wonderful Valentines day mi amor. Te amare asta mi ultimo suspiro 
            y no se que haria sin ti mi amor te amare por simpre.

            and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and 
            there I will be buried. May the Lord deal with me be it ever so severely, if even death seperates you and me."
